# smooth-motion-coding

A Codex-friendly starter template for Motion Canvas projects.

## Background

Starting a new Motion Canvas project from scratch with Codex can be time-consuming.  
Before it can help, Codex has to “learn” the framework from the project files, which costs both time and tokens.

[Motion Canvas](https://motioncanvas.io) is a relatively small and focused framework, so a well-prepared starter project with clear instructions is a much better way to work.  
This template gives Codex everything it needs up front, so you can:

- avoid repeating the same setup steps,
- reduce framework “learning” overhead for Codex, and
- start coding animations faster.
